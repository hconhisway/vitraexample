# Summary
1. **Napoleon's Army Size Variation**: P7 highlighted that Napoleon's army size varied across different Russian regions, being largest in the Kanas region and smallest in Moscow, prompting a discussion on the reasons behind this decrease from Kanas to Moscow.

2. **Visual Representation Inquiry**: P8 inquired about the meaning of [this red bar](`laser_indexes=[0], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and [this black line](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), seeking clarification on their representations.

3. **Interpretation of Visuals**: P7 explained that [this line](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) indicates the army size at each position through the thickness of the band, with the black representing losses due to temperature and other factors, and the red indicating the current army size at specific locations.

4. **Temperature's Impact on Army Size**: P8 noted an initial army size of 422,000, observing fluctuations in size potentially due to temperature changes, suggesting that retreats in October and December were influenced by temperature variations, including a [sudden spike](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) in losses due to a drop to -11 degrees in November.

5. **Urban Segregation Analysis**: The discussion shifted to analyzing urban segregation in U.S. cities, identifying patterns of segregation based on ethnicity, with specific observations made in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, and a hypothetical "Utah shortcut City." Key observations included the majority presence of certain ethnic groups in specific areas, influenced by factors such as living costs and community clustering.

6. **Ethnic Distribution and Living Costs**: P7 and P8 discussed the distribution of ethnic groups across five cities, noting trends like the concentration of white, Asian, and Hispanic populations in more affluent areas compared to predominantly black neighborhoods in less expensive areas. They also observed the majority presence of white people in certain areas, suggesting community following and economic factors as influencing residential patterns.

7. **Climate Change and Environmental Effects**: The conversation concluded with an examination of climate change effects, including the analysis of hurricane patterns, active fire hotspots, and Arctic sea ice levels. Observations included the increasing strength of hurricanes over time, the identification of Russia as a significant hotspot for active fires, and the drastic decrease in Arctic sea ice since 1970, attributing these changes to global climate change.

# Transcript
P8:  It could be the leading factor of that. And what do you mean by [this red bar](`laser_indexes=[0], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and what is [this black line](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) represent?

P6:  So as you could see in [this line](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) it is given the thickness of the band show the size of the army at each position.

P8:  But there are two thickness, red and black. Yeah.

P6:  So it's written there in the next slide. The path of the Napoleon's retreat from Moscow is grounded by the dark lower back. So this is the eligible position of the retreat which is tied to the temperature and discuss it. Right. So yeah you can see the black represents the amount of army that is being detrimental due to the temperature and all other factors. Okay. And I think this red is the amount of the army present, currently present at that particular location.

P8:  Okay. Yeah. So initially it started with 422 thousand armies and then we saw initial a bit of drop and then raise the drop maybe because of the temperature. As we can see that the temperature went from 26 degree number to 30 degree and because there was increase in the temperature which reflect the minimum drop in the army operation.

P6:  So you are suggesting that in [the October](`laser_indexes=[5], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) they started retreating because the temperature was high and they retreated in [December](`laser_indexes=[6], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) because the temperature was.

P8:  Yeah. And then there was a [sudden spike](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) because the temperature increased from 30 degree to minus eleven degree that we can see in [the graph](`laser_indexes=[9,10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) event. And then there was a [sudden drop](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) again because of [foreign temperature](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) in [November](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) that was [21 degree](`laser_indexes=[11,12], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

P6:  But if we see that the temperature given it is maximum in the time of October and which is pointing towards Moscow. So the temperature is maximum during the Moscow and it's minimum in December which is present in [the region of](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). I think these numbers are the amount of army that is being retrieved. So yeah you could see the army like the amount of army retreating is like reducing as a temperature, it decreases with time.

P8:  Yeah. So let's move to the second image.

P6:  Okay. Let us give some.

P8:  C So while you are observing the image you can raise the prompts. Like part two, there are prime maps.

P8:  Okay, part two there are prime maps showing different us cities segregation conditions. Here, one dot represent one PDP. Different ethical groups are colored in different color. Our task would be first for each map we have to identify any pattern in how neighbor of goods are segregated. The second subtask would be to compare [these different cities](`laser_indexes=[14,15], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) and find out the similarities and differences that we see based on [the pattern of segregation](`laser_indexes=[16,17], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). And even we can research any other finding that we could find. In my opinion, if we see [this area of the map that is represented in the blue color](`laser_indexes=[14], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). So this represents [the black ethical group](`laser_indexes=[15], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). And it's obvious we can see that [the whole region](`laser_indexes=[16], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) over [here](`laser_indexes=[17], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`), most of them are [the black people](`laser_indexes=[17], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). So the neighbors are segregated based on the [ethical group](`laser_indexes=[14,15,16,17,18], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). But even I can see there are a small number of green dots which represent [the white people](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). So in [this region](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) there are two types of people living, but the majority would be the.

P6:  Correct data also. And before going further, let us describe what are the five cities we are talking. Okay, so in my opinion, the five cities are. First is York, one is Jersey City, one is Brooklyn, which you just talked about. One is queens. I saw it somewhere. Yeah. Queens. And these are people were only able to identify four. [Washington](`laser_indexes=[21], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`), highlighted.

P8:  [Orient on the top of the map](`laser_indexes=[22], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). [Map key](`laser_indexes=[23], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). Are you able to see my cursor?

P6:  Oh, central north. That is too far.

P8:  Yeah.

P6:  So better we just keep it as like the middle because it is in the center. Okay.

P8:  So yeah.

P6:  What we could see is that from a generalist perspective, that New York is accommodated more by [the green and the red orange block](`laser_indexes=[25], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). And if you see the labels, the green represent white, red represents Asia and orange represents Hispanic.

P8:  Okay.

P6:  So in my opinion, what it shows is that since we know that [Manhattan](`laser_indexes=[26,27], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) is a very expensive place to live, so this represents that the white, asian, Hispanic are more valued than the ones living in the. Okay. Because you can see the Brooklyn is cheaper than Manhattan and it is mostly accomplished by the black people. That is one differentiation that we could give.

P8:  I think the people follow their community, so we can see that the entire community of black people are living in [specific area](`laser_indexes=[28], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) as compared to the other. If you see the New York, the majority, we can't see [the majority](`laser_indexes=[29], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) of people being a black, but there is a part of a people where [the Asians live](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). Yeah. So should we. We move to the third graph.

P6:  Okay. These are the five cities. So that was the New York City. Only in [this city](`laser_indexes=[31], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) we could see the somehow the discretion. The black are mostly living. The most of you blacks people are living in the [downwards of the Chicago](`laser_indexes=[32], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) and the white are living. And if we could see that there are lots of hispanic people which are spread in both [the sides of the Chicago](`laser_indexes=[31], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) that is [northern](`laser_indexes=[32], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`), and there are very few asian living in [the city](`laser_indexes=[32], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`).

P8:  Yeah. And we can even see that the majority of the people are [black](`laser_indexes=[33,34], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`), hispanic, asian, and white there are hardly we can see any other ethical group in the [Chicago area](`laser_indexes=[33], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) and we can even see that [majority](`laser_indexes=[34], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) of, I mean we can say [50 of them](`laser_indexes=[33], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) are occupied by the white people in Chicago because [majority of them](`laser_indexes=[34,35], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) are [green dotted](`laser_indexes=[36,37], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`). Yeah. Let's move to [the loss images](`laser_indexes=[38], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`).

P6:  And if we see here like it is a drastic change from the other two images, most of the places are occupied by [the spanish people](`laser_indexes=[39,40], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`). There are [two patches of the red](`laser_indexes=[39], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`) among the spanning locality and we could see like in [the west](`laser_indexes=[40], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`), the [west](`laser_indexes=[39], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`) is mostly occupied by the [white people](`laser_indexes=[40], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`). Middle is occupied by Andrest is occupied with.

P8:  Yeah. And we can see your little bit of around [the center Los Angeles](`laser_indexes=[41], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`).

P6:  Yeah.

P8:  If we see [this area](`laser_indexes=[42], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`) there is all type of material group in this area. We can see [the red dots](`laser_indexes=[42], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`), [yellow, green and blue](`laser_indexes=[42], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`).

P6:  So in my opinion this is because this is the main city itself. So majority of the work happening in the city is this place. And since we know the areas near the bridge are more clear than the. So yeah, it is again occupied with the white.

P8:  Let's move to Boston. The first thought for me is the majority of the people living in [the Boston](`laser_indexes=[43], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`) are white, more than 90 and there are few with the black in [this region](`laser_indexes=[44], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`). But rather than that I can't see major asian people Boston area. The reason might be because of the cost of living in Boston. India.

P6:  Yeah. So this is a trend we could see in the five cities that white people are mostly occupying the places which are not affluent and the black people are somewhat minorities apart from Chicago.

P8:  And.

P6:  Like.

P8:  This is our city, [Utah shortcut City](`laser_indexes=[45], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`). Okay. People [here](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`) we can see that majority of the people are dominated by white people and there are few. The [main city](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`), the Rose park where you can see all the ethical groups fields you can see few dots of [asian red](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`). Even we can see [the pink dots](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`). So rather than the four majority ethical groups we can see [few other groups](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`).

P6:  Yeah. Again this is due to the fact that this is the major part of the Salt Lake city like the downtown where most of the things happen. All kinds of people live in need to work but residentially, if we speak Salt Lake Valley is an expensive place to live. So again, like it is occupied very wide.

P8:  So I guess that wear the price it is that we discussed. Let's move to the next graph.

P6:  This graph I want to point out is that in this graph if we could see if we just try to divide this line or like this line, we could see that on the east side most of the places are occupied by the white people with small patches of youth, like in the Maryland and Memphis. But in the west we could see in particularly California there are very large blocks of hispanic and asian people.

P8:  Yeah. And [this](`laser_indexes=[47], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) might be a reason because in [the California side](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`), the majority of [there](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) are [it companies](`laser_indexes=[49], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`), the university. So because of that there might be a few population group as compared to [the New York](`laser_indexes=[47], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) and [the freightmost side](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) of [the US](`laser_indexes=[49], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`). But if we see the center part, there are hardly [the people](`laser_indexes=[49], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`). So the majority of the ethical groups are living on [either side](`laser_indexes=[48,49], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) of the United States.

P6:  Yeah. And middle part is like empty. But lucky [these states](`laser_indexes=[50], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) are empty.

P8:  Yeah. And there might be [few population](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) in [the Utah and Arizona](`laser_indexes=[52], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`). This might be because of [few industries](`laser_indexes=[52], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) and [good universities](`laser_indexes=[53], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) and. Yeah. Even Las Vegas because of [the tourism](`laser_indexes=[54], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`). Yeah, tourism.

P6:  Yeah. This is the next page. I will be reading the prompt and climate change. Discuss what you find from graph. So this graph shows us the long term between the global temperature and the climate change. And there is a label given to us.

P8:  Yeah. So we should start with [this graph](`laser_indexes=[56], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). Storms are.

P6:  We could see that with the increase in time, the amount of hurricanes, or like the hurricanes are getting stronger and stronger. Average power, like the guide power is increased with the 2060, like there was an average of like current.

P8:  Yeah. And even we can see in [the span of 20 years](`laser_indexes=[57,58,59], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), the storms are [constant](`laser_indexes=[57], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), but there is [sudden increase](`laser_indexes=[58], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) after 20 years and then again it is [flat](`laser_indexes=[59], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) for [next 20 years](`laser_indexes=[60], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). So we can see it may get [increased](`laser_indexes=[57], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) for [next](`laser_indexes=[58], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) [20 years](`laser_indexes=[59,60], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). From 2020 to 2024, we may see the [increasing](`laser_indexes=[61], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) the storms based on the pattern that we can analyze in this graph. Let's move to the next.

P6:  So this is the graph shows the active fires by the provided like countries. Australia, United States.

P8:  Yeah. We can see by immediate, by the rap that Russia is the active fire hotspot in Russia are more as compared to United States and Australia. But in [the initial march month](`laser_indexes=[62], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) we can see there was [sudden spike](`laser_indexes=[63,64], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), but moreover it was bad for [next three months](`laser_indexes=[63], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). And for United States it is [the lowest](`laser_indexes=[64], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in my opinion. But we can see a [spike](`laser_indexes=[62,63], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in [September](`laser_indexes=[64,65], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

P6:  And we could also notice that the black line represents the average of the years 2001. To notice 2020 is by the orange line. We could see in the United States in the month of September, there's a huge spike compared to the previous years. If you could see like the 2020 was definitely some differentiator and it could be pointed out due to the COVID effect.

P8:  Yeah. And even in Russia, if we see [this section of two months of this quarter last June](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). So [every year](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), if we see [the data of last 20 years](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), we can see that there is a constant active fire out spot over this quarter from March to June. Let's go to next.

P6:  This picture represents the amount of ice in the arctic sea from the year 1970. And we could see that the amount of ice has been drastically decreasing with respect to the year.

P8:  In my opinion. I guess the black guy represent the year 2020 and rest of them represent 1979. The [pattern](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) is [constant](`laser_indexes=[69], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) over the years and maybe [August](`laser_indexes=[70], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), October. It is low waste.

P6:  Yeah. This could be accounted for their climate changes because in the winter seasons the amount of ice freezes and then after [village start decreasing](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). And the month of September.

P8:  Yeah, I do.

P6:  Different part.

P8:  Okay.

P8:  C Hi guys, let me stop here. Let.
