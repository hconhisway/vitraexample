# Summary
<!-- ## Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812

During Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812, Alice explained that the thickness of the depicted band on a visual aid represented the size of the French army at various locations, with the dark lower band denoting the path of retreat from Moscow, correlating with temperature and time. She noted key events of the march, including the army's entry into Moscow from the red region and its subsequent return. The army's size, initially 422,000 soldiers, decreased over time due to various factors, with a representation of 1 mm for every 10,000 soldiers. The reduction in the army's size, including an unexplained decrease to 400,000 soldiers, was attributed to battles, climate, and other factors.

Bob added that the initial decrease in troop numbers from [422,000](`laser_indexes=[0]`) to [400,000](`laser_indexes=[1]`) could be due to military engagements or strategic redeployments, such as sending reinforcements to [another front](`laser_indexes=[3]`). During the retreat from Moscow, adverse weather conditions exacerbated the army's losses, with temperatures falling significantly, contributing to [decreasing army strength and casualties](`laser_indexes=[5,6]`).

Alice highlighted the lack of clarity regarding the causes of the army's deviation and significant losses. From an initial strength of 422,000 troops, the army was reduced to 100,000 upon reaching Moscow, and further diminished to around [10,000](`laser_indexes=[12]`) upon return. The substantial reduction indicated severe attrition during both the advance and retreat.

Bob observed a consistent pattern of attrition, particularly noting [heavy losses](`laser_indexes=[17]`) around Viasma. A clear [trend](`laser_indexes=[20]`) of increasing casualties was identified, marking a significant depletion of Napoleon's forces.

Alice concluded that the severe weather conditions, with temperatures dropping significantly from October to December, played a critical role in the army's hardships. The decrease to -21 degrees highlighted the impact of [climatic conditions](`laser_indexes=[23]`) on the campaign's outcome, underscoring the harsh conditions faced by Napoleon's army during their retreat.

## Transition to American Segregation and Population Distribution

Bob suggested transitioning to a new visualization for their analysis and opted to select a specific dataset. Alice agreed, emphasizing the importance of consensus to continue their collaboration effectively. Bob introduced the visualization, explaining it depicted the historical segregation in the United States, with a focus on the distribution of various ethnic groups represented by different colors; each dot symbolized 12,000 individuals. He highlighted the objective of identifying demographic patterns and relevant factors, particularly noting segregation's visibility in the eastern part of the country.

Alice requested additional context to provide accurate assistance, prompting Bob to detail that white populations are predominantly found in [clusters](`laser_indexes=[25]`) across states like Massachusetts, Philadelphia, New York, and Washington. In the west, Hispanic populations form significant clusters, indicative of migration trends from Mexico into California and Texas, identified as [isolated clusters](`laser_indexes=[25,26]`). Alice confirmed observing a larger Hispanic population in Texas and California.

Bob indicated the presence of the Amish community in various locations, including Arkansas and Chicago, and noted cities with high black populations. This graph also illustrated [the current demographic trends](`laser_indexes=[33]`). Alice contributed her observation of demographic distributions in the southwest and southeast, highlighting dense urban populations without a common race in major cities.

Discussing rural demographics, Bob observed a clear east-west divide, with significant populations in cities like [Salt Lake City](`laser_indexes=[38]`), [Denver](`laser_indexes=[39]`), [Seattle](`laser_indexes=[40]`), and [Portland](`laser_indexes=[41]`), situated in the [western side](`laser_indexes=[42]`) of the country. He noted sparse populations in Montana, [North Dakota](`laser_indexes=[35,36,37,38,39]`), and [South Dakota](`laser_indexes=[40,41,42,43,44]`), suggesting social and economic patterns influencing these distributions.

Alice speculated on the reasons behind population concentrations, while Bob questioned the demographic diversity in California, particularly the absence of the black population, symbolized by [blue](`laser_indexes=[46]`). Alice clarified that such populations are more prevalent in [the southeast](`laser_indexes=[47]`), where blue dots are more concentrated.

Concluding their discussion, Alice suggested proceeding to the next visualization, with Bob ready to present further analysis, maintaining a focus on the original intentions and key details of the conversation in a formal and concise manner.

## Analyzing Urban Segregation and Population Patterns

Alice initiated the discussion by proposing a topic for analysis, which was met with Bob's offer of further assistance. The task at hand was to examine long-term trends in global temperatures and climate change, focusing on the analysis of graphs that represented years on the x-axis and the number of storms on the y-axis, with each color denoting a distinct category. Bob clarified that category four storms were symbolized by [dark purple](`laser_indexes=[48]`), and category five storms by a [darker shade of purple](`laser_indexes=[49]`).

Alice noted that the data, represented by a ten-year rolling average, indicated an increase in the number of storms from 1980 to 2020, particularly highlighting a surge in category five storms in [a specific region](`laser_indexes=[50]`) between 2015 and 2020, though [this region](`laser_indexes=[50]`) experienced [fewer storms](`laser_indexes=[51]`) compared to other periods. Bob's analysis revealed a pattern where from 1960 to 1980, the activity was average with a [straight line](`laser_indexes=[52,53]`), followed by an increase from 1980 to 2000. From 2000 to 2020, the trend appeared [constant](`laser_indexes=[53]`), with fluctuations resembling a [sine wave pattern](`laser_indexes=[55]`), suggesting a periodic increase and decrease in storm activity. This pattern could potentially be attributed to phenomena like [El Nino](`laser_indexes=[57,58]`), though Bob expressed uncertainty.

Alice emphasized the concerning trend of an increase in both the frequency and intensity of storms over time, particularly noting a rise in category five storms from 2010 to 2020. She proposed moving on to the next task upon concluding this analysis. Bob then introduced a new task involving the analysis of segregation conditions in various US cities, using maps where each dot represented 120 people and different colors indicated different ethnic groups. The initial observation highlighted a concentration of Hispanic people in the north, Black people in the south, and a notable [cluster in the central portion](`laser_indexes=[60]`) of the map.

Alice and Bob discussed the distribution of ethnic groups, noting the widespread presence of [red dots](`laser_indexes=[63]`) indicating Asian populations, contrasting with the more concentrated areas of Black and Hispanic populations. They observed a change in the diversity of groups moving [southward](`laser_indexes=[67]`), indicating possible psychological or residential trends influencing segregation patterns. Bob mentioned a [multicultural area](`laser_indexes=[71]`), while Alice sought clarification on the distinction between red and yellow dots, indicating different ethnic groups or densities.

This conversation aimed to synthesize observations from graphical data analysis on climate trends and urban segregation, emphasizing the increase in storm frequency and intensity over time, as well as the complex patterns of ethnic segregation in US cities, maintaining a formal and summarized third-person narrative.

## Comparison of Cities for Segregation Patterns

Bob proposed transitioning their analysis to a different city for comparison with Boston, to which Alice agreed and suggested examining Salix city. Upon review, Alice noted that Lake City predominantly housed a white population, evidenced by widespread [green dots](`laser_indexes=[78]`), and a notable concentration of white and Hispanic demographics, with Black representation being less dense, as indicated by [blue dots](`laser_indexes=[79,80]`). She identified a specific area where [red dots were observed alongside yellow dots](`laser_indexes=[77,78]`), highlighting a mix of ethnicities albeit minimal.

Bob observed an even distribution of communities within the city, with no significant clustering, which contrasted with other areas they had studied. He noted the integration of Hispanics and whites throughout, pinpointing locations with a notable Hispanic presence [at these places](`laser_indexes=[81,82,83]`). Additionally, Bob remarked on the unique presence of [purple dots in Boston](`laser_indexes=[83,84]`), representing a diverse ethnic group not observed in other states.

Alice requested a return to the Boston analysis, admitting oversight regarding pink dots, which Bob clarified as the only observed color variation, not purple. Alice acknowledged seeing [pink dots at a specific location](`laser_indexes=[85]`) upon revisiting the data.

Discussing the city of Alex, Alice observed a lack of [clustering](`laser_indexes=[86]`) outside the downtown area, indicating a spatial spread of the population, contrasting with the [densely populated clusters in Boston](`laser_indexes=[88]`). Bob concurred, describing the population distribution as both more and less dense in different areas, with red dots in Harrymann South Jordan and [various areas](`laser_indexes=[89]`) indicative of a sizeable Indian community. This analysis provided insights into the demographic composition and distribution patterns across different cities, maintaining a focus on formal and summarized third-person narrative.

## Global Temperature Trends and Climate Change Analysis

Alice expressed an inability to discern rental information, to which Bob responded by pointing out their location [here](`laser_indexes=[90]`). Alice proposed adopting an alternative strategy, a suggestion Bob welcomed gratefully. Both expressed confidence in achieving their goal, with Bob acknowledging understanding. Alice requested an analysis of long-term global temperature trends and climate change, based on laboratory findings, before progressing to the next subject. She noted the completion of an analysis on active fire hotspots throughout 2020, across Australia, Russia, and the United States, utilizing data from NASA's Terra satellite. The analysis differentiated between average and active fire locations, with a particular focus on the representation of fire occurrences in Australia.

Bob summarized the data as indicative of the significant number of fires in Australia, a sentiment Alice agreed with, noting the substantial figures at the start of the year. Discussions then shifted to the comparative analysis of fire incidents across the three countries throughout 2020, observing that the peak fire activities occurred in different months for each country. Alice detailed that Australia experienced its peak in January, Russia from June to September, and the United States in September, implying a varied temporal distribution of peak fire activities.

Bob made an observation regarding anomalies in the trends for Australia and the United States in January and October, respectively, where the 20-year trend line showed deviations. He noted that Russia's fire occurrences align with the 20-year average, suggesting a yearly recurrence, particularly highlighted in April, May, July, and August due to potential environmental phenomena. This pattern contrasted with the unusual intensity of fires in Australia in January and a historic event in the United States in September, which broke a 20-year record.

Alice suggested that these anomalies might be attributed to climatic factors, such as climate change or higher temperatures. Bob referenced significant fires in California and Australia at the start of 2020 to underscore this point. He also explained the lower tendency for fires during colder months, with a specific mention of December, and clarified that Australia experiences its winter in June and July, not December, due to its Southern Hemisphere location. This seasonal variation contributed to a misunderstanding regarding the 20-year average fire activity from September to December, which Bob corrected. -->



## Analyzing Napoleon's Russian Campaign Visualization

Alice began the discussion by explaining that the map illustrates the losses suffered by Napoleon's army during the Russian campaign of 1812. The thickness of the depicted band represents the size of the army at various positions, with the dark lower band correlating the retreat from Moscow with temperature and timescale. She pointed out that the march commenced from [the starting point](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and highlighted the words that marked the locations [Napoleon's army passed through](`laser_indexes=[3,4], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

Bob added that the main troop passed through another location, suggesting a straightforward progression.

Alice speculated that [the little branches](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) represented soldiers diverging to different locations and noted that [the bottom](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) of the map showed [the temperature](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) of [the region](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), which was very [cold](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). She observed a significant [decrease in the army's size](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) in areas where [the red](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) [dead](`laser_indexes=[12], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) band got smaller, correlating with extremely low temperatures from [negative 30 to negative eleven](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). However, in [certain regions](`laser_indexes=[15], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), the number of soldiers seemed to diminish less.

Bob theorized that the army's reduction in size, particularly after crossing a river, might be attributed to battles or adverse conditions, as indicated by [the multiple beer](`laser_indexes=[17], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). He suggested that the army's goal was to reach [Moscow](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and then retreat, possibly hastened by [the cold weather](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or [really low temperatures](`laser_indexes=[21], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

Alice clarified that the temperature timeline at the bottom of the map corresponded to the army's retreat, spanning [from November 9 to December 7](`laser_indexes=[22], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), indicating it did not represent the temperature during the march towards Moscow.

Bob and Alice discussed the absence of temperature data for the march towards Moscow, with Bob suggesting that the march occurred in October, a relatively warmer period before the onset of the Russian winter.

Alice noted a dramatic decrease in the army's size in [a specific region](`laser_indexes=[26], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), suggesting a temporary increase in troops before a significant reduction. Bob added that some troops might have learned of the main army's retreat and decided to merge with them, especially during river crossings, which were notably impacted by [the cold weather](`laser_indexes=[35], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

Alice highlighted that every river crossing was marked by a [dramatic decrease](`laser_indexes=[37], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) in troop numbers, emphasizing the stark contrast between the army's initial size and its remnants upon return. She also mentioned [a scale](`laser_indexes=[40], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) on the map, possibly for reference.

Discussing temperature measurements, Alice speculated on the scale used, suggesting that [the temperatures](`laser_indexes=[45], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) might be in a different scale, with a conversion table available for reference.

Bob hypothesized that the army's losses during the retreat could be attributed to unpreparedness for the [warm season](`laser_indexes=[48,49,50,51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), lacking adequate clothing or shelter for the winter. This lack of preparation, coupled with the Russian troops' readiness for the cold, might have forced Napoleon's retreat from [Moscow](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

Alice concluded that Napoleon might not have anticipated the campaign's length, expecting it to conclude before winter, which led to the unprepared retreat from Moscow. She expressed curiosity about the initial decrease in troop numbers upon entering Russia and suggested moving on to the next part of their analysis.

## Global Temperature and Climate Change Trends

Bob suggested altering the direction of their analysis towards examining the ascent of global temperatures and climate change trends. Alice then introduced a segment focusing on long-term trends in global temperature and climate change, as depicted on [the graph](`laser_indexes=[55], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). She highlighted the graph's depiction of seasonal temperature cycles from 1880 to 2020, emphasizing the average temperature increase over this period.

Bob explained that each line on the graph represents a different year, allowing for a comparison of temperature trends across years. Alice noted the graph spanned from [January to December](`laser_indexes=[56], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), observing that the average temperature in 2020 was higher than in previous years, with lighter lines indicating cooler temperatures at the bottom and darker lines, representing warmer temperatures, [on top](`laser_indexes=[58,59], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). This pattern suggested a consistent increase in temperature across every month.

Alice then shifted the discussion to another aspect of global temperature and climate change, focusing on the frequency of storms with speeds over 110 mph from 1960 to 2020. She observed a [gradual increase](`laser_indexes=[66], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) in the number of such storms, noting a significant instance that exceeded 156 mph.

Bob remarked on the stability of storm frequencies since 1960, suggesting a notable increase in category four storms, which Alice confirmed, pointing out the dramatic increase in [the surface area](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) of [the boxes](`laser_indexes=[69], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), indicating a rise in category four storms compared to category five. They discussed the possibility of less vegetation leading to more severe storms, though the exact connection was uncertain.

The conversation then moved to an analysis of [active fire hotspots](`laser_indexes=[79], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) based on data from NASA satellites. Alice highlighted a [huge spike](`laser_indexes=[81], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in fire activity in Australia in January, unprecedented in the observed trend. Bob speculated on seasonal differences affecting fire activity in Australia and Russia, suggesting climatic parallels between the United States and Russia in different months.

Alice pointed out that the black line represents the average fire activity over recent years, suggesting that while 2020's average might appear low, there were still significant spikes in activity. Bob hypothesized that the increased fire activity in 2020, particularly noted in September in the United States and January in Australia, could be indirectly related to the pandemic, affecting the management of fire activities.

Lastly, the discussion turned to Arctic sea ice coverage. Alice explained that the y-axis represented [the ice coverage area](`laser_indexes=[83], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), with a general trend indicating that higher temperatures correlated with lower ice coverage. She noted that the hottest part of the year shifted towards [September and October](`laser_indexes=[90], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), with 2020 showing significantly lower [ice coverage](`laser_indexes=[93], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) compared to previous years, suggesting a link to [global warming](`laser_indexes=[94,95], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

## COVID-19 Evolution and Impact Analysis

Bob began the discussion by hypothesizing that the decrease in error during the summer months might be attributed to warmer temperatures, suggesting that this trend would continue until it becomes colder around October.

Alice then shifted the conversation to the topic of COVID-19, explaining how the virus has evolved into different strains over time. She described a visualization that showed the global evolution of the coronavirus through the proportion of different types, with each color representing a different strain and the axes indicating time (from January to November) and the prevalence of these variants in the population. Initially, the original strain dominated but gradually decreased as it evolved into different strains, such as the V and the first mu variant, which also decreased over time. The Gh variant emerged during this period and became the majority strain for a considerable duration, while the GV variant appeared later but quickly became prevalent by November.

Bob speculated that the initial decrease in certain strains might have been accelerated by the introduction of vaccines, which could have been more effective against these earlier variants. Alice agreed, suggesting that the immune system's better defense against earlier variants might have led to the evolution of more resistant strains, which remained prevalent for longer periods.

Discussing the differences in the evolution of the virus between the US and India, Alice noted that the US managed to maintain a relatively high infection rate from the start, whereas India saw an exponential increase in infections later in the year. She observed that the US was effective in controlling earlier mutants, which decreased rapidly, but later variants became dominant. In contrast, India's response seemed less strategic, leading to a more chaotic spread of the virus.

Bob and Alice then discussed the timing of the virus's spread, noting that all strains seemed to start simultaneously. Bob suggested that this simultaneous emergence might be due to a large number of people still suffering from previous COVID-19 types, a situation that was not the case in India. Bob also raised the possibility that the different trajectories of infection rates between the US and India could reflect disparities in vaccine availability and distribution, implying that India's distinct pattern might be due to insufficient vaccination coverage.

Lastly, Alice introduced a mutation graph showing the virus's evolution step by step, with the y-axis representing time. They identified a common ancestor from which the virus branched off into different strains, likening the visualization to a phylogenetic tree. This analysis highlighted the virus's lineage, showing how certain strains were more closely related to the original variant, while others were more distant.

Bob expressed uncertainty about the specific dates, but Alice clarified that the data collection concluded on November 3, marking the end of their analysis period.

## Mutation Graph Analysis of COVID-19

Alice introduced the final visual representation under discussion, a mutation graph illustrating the evolution of [the virus](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) through sequential mutations. She encouraged an examination of the graph, specifically noting the names and colors of the strains and mentioning that the graph's ancestor was determined by backtracking mutations. Alice highlighted that [the first](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) point on the graph and [the y-axis](`laser_indexes=[150], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) represented [time](`laser_indexes=[151], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`).

Bob noted that the figure marked a specific date, November 3, indicating the timeline of data representation.

Alice elaborated on the graph's details, pointing out [the common ancestor](`laser_indexes=[156,157], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) of the virus and the point where it [branches off](`laser_indexes=[161,162,163], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) into different [strains](`laser_indexes=[164,165,166], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). She compared the branching pattern to a phylogeny tree, suggesting that the [svaris strain](`laser_indexes=[157,158,159], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) was closely related to [the original one](`laser_indexes=[160,161,162], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). Alice further observed that [the early semper strain](`laser_indexes=[154], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) and [others](`laser_indexes=[155,156], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`), including [the ovaries strain](`laser_indexes=[157,158], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`), shared a [common ancestor](`laser_indexes=[159,160], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`), indicating their similarity. Conversely, [the B virus strain](`laser_indexes=[161,162], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) and [these ones](`laser_indexes=[163,164], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) were identified as [more distant](`laser_indexes=[165,166], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) from the original virus.

Bob, uncertain about the specifics beyond the noted date of November 3, acknowledged the timeline but expressed confusion regarding the date's significance.

Alice clarified that the data collection for the mutation graph concluded on [November 3](`laser_indexes=[170,172], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`), marking the end point of the observed viral evolution within the study's scope.

# Transcript
[(00:00:06)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Part one. This map portrays the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the russian campaign of 1812. The fingers of the sink band shows the size of the army at each position. Half of the Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in the cold warthuries depicted by the dark lower band which is tied to temperature and timescale. Discuss the key events of the Toyota march. We can discuss the type of location timing and cost of the event. Okay so I guess this is where [these march started](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). And [these words](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) mark the locations that [he went through](`laser_indexes=[3,4], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:00:56)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Like this part just go through another place with the main troop.

[(00:01:10)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  So I guess [the little branches](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) are just like soldiers going to different places. And then on [the bottom](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) is [the temperature](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) of [the region](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So it seems it's all very [cold](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). And then I guess the [decrease](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) was seen the most [over here](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) as the [red](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) [dead](`laser_indexes=[12], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) is getting smaller. And that corresponds to a really low temperature. So from [negative 30 to negative eleven](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). And then in [these regions](`laser_indexes=[15], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) it seems like the number of soldiers didn't decrease that much. Okay.

[(00:02:17)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  That'S for the. For this part the equation is because of data cross the river and there may be some there may be some [here](`laser_indexes=[16], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) because I'm. And we can see that from the [multiple beer](`laser_indexes=[17], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Actually when they just shut the [bacteria](`laser_indexes=[18], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) didn't mean that they may not have a [bad battle](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) [here](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So this means that they may just go to [Moscow](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and then they could exhaust the [cold weather](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or the [really low temperature](`laser_indexes=[21], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). They just go back even they die. Have a rate. Yeah.

[(00:03:19)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Actually now that I'm looking at this diagram I think the temperature on the bottling corresponds to when they were retreating set up when they were going to Roscoe. Because it's going [from November 9 to December 7](`laser_indexes=[22], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:03:34)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah. The flat part that showed phase.

[(00:03:41)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Right. I guess it didn't show the temperature when they were going towards Moscow. Right. There's no information [temperature](`laser_indexes=[25], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) there.

[(00:03:57)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  I think. Because when they have to run to Moscow tonight I think the four day October. So it means that it's kind of warm at that time. Right. It starts from October and I think from October that the Russian just goes through with winter season.

[(00:04:15)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Right. Yeah. You can see that the decrease is very traumatic from in [this region](`laser_indexes=[26], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Then I guess they had more troops coming in that reunited around [this time](`laser_indexes=[28], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). But then again it [decreased](`laser_indexes=[29], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) by a lot. [Yeah](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:04:42)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  And I think at [this part](`laser_indexes=[31], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) maybe that. I just think that at [this part](`laser_indexes=[32], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and other tropes [here](`laser_indexes=[33], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) they just heard that the main trope is just retreating so they just follow them and they just merge with them. And then also they create a lot when they [cut to cross this river](`laser_indexes=[34], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) I think [the cold weather](`laser_indexes=[35], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or maybe they have some. Yeah.

[(00:05:15)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Also like [this part](`laser_indexes=[36], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) you can see every time they cross the river there seems to be a [dramatic decrease](`laser_indexes=[37], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). And then once they go back there's like a huge contrast between how many people they started with and how many they ended up with. Yeah. And then [here](`laser_indexes=[39], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) there's a [scale](`laser_indexes=[40], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). I guess.

[(00:05:57)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Somebody.

[(00:06:01)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Just said also. Yeah I didn't know. What's [the R degree](`laser_indexes=[42], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) for CNN? Yeah. Oh maybe [thermometer](`laser_indexes=[43], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So I guess like [these temperatures](`laser_indexes=[45], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) are in [this scale](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) not Celsius but [here](`laser_indexes=[47], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) we can convert that using this table later.

[(00:06:50)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Then I think maybe they at the time maybe the reason why they suffer loss from the provider maybe because they suffer from a really [warm season](`laser_indexes=[48,49,50,51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So they didn't prepare any [clouds](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or any [dust](`laser_indexes=[49], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) for the winter. So when they got to [Moscow](`laser_indexes=[50], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and they didn't have any preparation for the others this may be the reason why they have to retrieve from they have to retrieve from [Moscow](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) russian troops. I think they all live [there](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So they must have some preparation for the cold weather.

[(00:07:54)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah. So possible that he just didn't expect [this](`laser_indexes=[52], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) to take [this](`laser_indexes=[53], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) long. Probably thought that it would be finished before winter and then that's why he didn't do anything once they got to Moscow and just retreated. I wonder what caused the [decrease region](`laser_indexes=[54], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) when they first came into Russia. I think that's pretty much everything. For this one we need to change to the second one ourselves.

[(00:08:39)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  We can change everything direction to the accent.

[(00:08:48)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay so this one says part three. Can you analyze any long term trends in global temperature and climate change? That's what you find on [the graph](`laser_indexes=[55], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). And so unless there says seasonal temperature cycles from 1880 to 2020 to 20 average it.

[(00:09:26)](`current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) Bob:  Every line represents ear and different lines represented. So if we want to see the trend along different years compare across different lines.

[(00:09:45)](`current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. This is going from [January to December](`laser_indexes=[56], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). Yeah that's why it's lower in the middle. Unless that's during summer. And then I guess in 2020 the average temperature is higher than before because the lighter lines are more towards the bottom but the darker lines are [on top](`laser_indexes=[58,59], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). Across the entire year or so. Every single month it's hotter than before.

[(00:10:25)](`current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) Bob:  I think it should cap from the north part of the earth since that south part in the middle of the year.

[(00:10:41)](`current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. Think that's it. Maybe next one. Okay so again this is global temperature and climate change.

[(00:11:02)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Do you analyze any long term trends global temperature and climate change.

[(00:11:17)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Over 110 mph from 1960 to 2020. I guess the Y axis is [the number of stores](`laser_indexes=[62], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). That's over [110 miles](`laser_indexes=[63], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). [Progress](`laser_indexes=[64], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). And you can see [second](`laser_indexes=[65], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) general [gradual increase](`laser_indexes=[66], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) over the years. And there's even one that's over [156](`laser_indexes=[66], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:11:53)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Yes. Actually I think it is pretty stable. I think changed from 1960 for the high level. Like catch five. I think it's not catch five. Or maybe the cat four.

[(00:12:27)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah I agree. Cat four seems to be the most dramatic increase as you can see. I'm sure [the surface area](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) of [the boxes](`laser_indexes=[69], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) are a lot bigger than [some increase](`laser_indexes=[70], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) in cat five. But again [here](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) you also have a lot of [cat five](`laser_indexes=[72], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Yeah. So it's not like that [much different color](`laser_indexes=[73], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). It represents [different kind of links](`laser_indexes=[74], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) of it. Yes.

[(00:13:00)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  We don't know that. The raven.

[(00:13:06)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Not sure. Maybe like less trees so that they have greater storms. I don't know exactly how that helps.

[(00:13:16)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Or maybe just like today just because of the rate of the temperature.

[(00:13:28)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  There'S definitely like a [climate change](`laser_indexes=[77], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). If you're saying [more hurricanes](`laser_indexes=[78], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Okay next one. [Active fire hospice by Denny in 2020](`laser_indexes=[79], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). The data generated by NFASA satellites show about average fire activity yesterday russian space. So [the orange line](`laser_indexes=[80], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is firehouse blocks across the entire year and the black part is the average. I guess in Australia it seems like most of the trends overlap a little bit but definitely in January there's like a [huge spike](`laser_indexes=[81], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) that was not seen before.

[(00:14:30)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. And I think this maybe this one previous figure like in Australia I think outside to the north part I guess in the general autumn season maybe Australia maybe may happen in January. And for Russia I think it's because. Right. It's much colder than the United States though. I think the climate of September in United States may be similar to the climate in maybe July August in Russia. Like two eggs in Russia.

[(00:15:46)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  The black clarity represents the average from [these years](`laser_indexes=[82], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) but maybe like 2019, 2018, or 2017 are more similar. 2020 although the average looks low but it might still be spikes during these times in the previous few years. But we can't really say anything from this graph.

[(00:16:14)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Well I think in 2020 there are like huge increase huge increase in the active house especially in the peak part like in September in states and it January in Australia. I don't know the way. I'm just. Maybe. I don't know. I'm just testing with 2020 just like the pandemic. Just because of the pandemic maybe many people they just need to take charge of all these fair activities.

[(00:17:25)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Right okay yeah that could be. All right next one. Arctic sea ICE. Okay so this is similar to the other one. This is measuring Arctic sea ICE.

[(00:17:51)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Can you analyze any long term trend global temperatures in dimension. Global temperature.

[(00:18:06)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  So the y axis is [the ICE coverage area](`laser_indexes=[83], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). So the bridger the y is more ICE. So like [the general triangle](`laser_indexes=[84], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) [the same](`laser_indexes=[85], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). I think it's also quite as just to temperature. So over temperature you have higher [ICE coverage](`laser_indexes=[86,87,88], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). Lower temperature you have lower [ICE coverage](`laser_indexes=[89,90,91,92], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). I guess it's [the arctic](`laser_indexes=[89], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). So it's like slightly skewed to the right. So the hottest part is not during Libra like rather [September and October](`laser_indexes=[90], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). Yeah. And then [2020](`laser_indexes=[92], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) is obviously has relatively lower [ICE coverage](`laser_indexes=[93], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) comparing to older times. Also maybe implying that [global warming](`laser_indexes=[94,95], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) in recent years.

[(00:19:04)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. Then maybe that's because in summer it's warmer. The error keeps [decreasing](`laser_indexes=[96], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) until it gets. Until it gets colder. So it will [decrease](`laser_indexes=[97], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) until that October.

[(00:19:31)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah.

[(00:19:35)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  We will move on to the next one.

[(00:19:39)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  This one is COVID 19. Virus has evolved into different types of spread. Those shows how the global cool coronavirus has evolved in the proportion of different types. Analyze the evolutionary trends of different types of artists. Weekly breakdown of overload. Okay so [different color represents a different string](`laser_indexes=[102], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) [axis represents the time from January to November](`laser_indexes=[103], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`). Then [the x axis](`laser_indexes=[104], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) I guess represents how much of those variants are present in the population. So obviously the original one starts off almost 100 but then [decreases](`laser_indexes=[105], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) over time as it's evolving into different [strains](`laser_indexes=[106,107], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`). So it's so [V](`laser_indexes=[108], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) or [the first mu variant](`laser_indexes=[109], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) also kind of [decreases](`laser_indexes=[110], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) along [the line](`laser_indexes=[111], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) and then [Gh](`laser_indexes=[111], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) emerges during this time. Then it became like the majority of the virus for a long time. And the GV occurred kind of relatively later but takes off about like 50 of the tar variants by the time of [November](`laser_indexes=[112,113,114,115], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`).

[(00:21:22)](`current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) Bob:  I'm not sure about the year. I think this part for the first several types they decreased. I think they [decreased](`laser_indexes=[116], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) faster than the [remains types](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`). I think maybe because of [the vaccine](`laser_indexes=[118,119], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`).

[(00:21:42)](`current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) Alice:  Right. We probably have better immune dependence against these earlier variants when they first came out. But then from [these variants](`laser_indexes=[123], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) [these more resistant variants](`laser_indexes=[124], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) evolved. They're probably more [dentrous](`laser_indexes=[125], current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) immune system is less effective. They were there for a longer period with the same percentage.

[(00:22:13)](`current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) Bob:  And maybe that's because their symptoms gets lighter. So people will not pay so much attention will trade it so serious at the previous type. Something like that.

[(00:22:31)](`current_vis="CovidTypes.jpg"`) Alice:  Right. Okay next one compare and discuss the similarities and differences between us and India. The evolution of different virus type. So [the top is infection average](`laser_indexes=[127], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). It seems like in the US the infection stays relatively high ever since it all started. But in India it increased towards [later of the year](`laser_indexes=[129], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). So initially there was not that many infections but it kind of grew [exponentially](`laser_indexes=[130], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). It got worse and then it seems like the US was pretty effective in preventing the [earlier mutants](`laser_indexes=[131], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). It [decreased very rapidly](`laser_indexes=[133], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) but the later mutants kind of occupy the entire population. India it's kind of like [all over the place](`laser_indexes=[134], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). It seems they probably didn't have a really good strategy to prevent [the initial spread](`laser_indexes=[135], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`).

[(00:23:51)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah this part makes. The lack of any investigation is part of this record here.

[(00:24:02)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah some data type.

[(00:24:15)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Bob:  They all [start at the same time](`laser_indexes=[138], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`).

[(00:24:18)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Alice:  I think.

[(00:24:21)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Bob:  At [the same time](`laser_indexes=[140], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). That may be because at [that time](`laser_indexes=[141], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) there's still some. There's still large amount of people suffer from the previous types of COVID But for India for India it's not.

[(00:24:50)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Alice:  Half.

[(00:24:51)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Bob:  Of the people are new type of me I'm not sure if [India has the vaccine](`laser_indexes=[142], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). I think maybe it also shows for [this part](`laser_indexes=[143,144,145], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) it also shows like if we have some vaccines how the infections will behave and if we do not have. If we do not have the corresponding [vaccines](`laser_indexes=[144], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) how they. How the [virus](`laser_indexes=[145], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) will [spread](`laser_indexes=[146], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`). And for India that [thing](`laser_indexes=[148], current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) seems like maybe there's no sufficient vaccine so that they have totally different chance of the number of infections.

[(00:26:03)](`current_vis="CovidTypesUSIndia.jpg"`) Alice:  Next one. This is the last one. This mutation graph shows how [the virus](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) has evolved [step by step](`laser_indexes=[150], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). Discuss what you find in this graph. Open some of the names and colors of the screens. Ancestor based on backtracking of mutations. This is [the first](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). [The y axis](`laser_indexes=[150], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) is [the time](`laser_indexes=[151], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`).

[(00:26:49)](`current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) Bob:  And this figure only shows one guide as November 3. So I did November 3.

[(00:27:04)](`current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) Alice:  So I guess [here](`laser_indexes=[154,155], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) this is [the common ancestor](`laser_indexes=[156,157], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). And then [here](`laser_indexes=[158,159,160], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) is where it [branches off](`laser_indexes=[161,162,163], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) to different [strain](`laser_indexes=[164,165,166], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). So you can see like you're branching [psychophony tree](`laser_indexes=[154,155,156], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). So I guess the [svaris](`laser_indexes=[157,158,159], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) was the most related to the [original one](`laser_indexes=[160,161,162], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). And then I guess like [the early semper](`laser_indexes=[154], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) and [the others](`laser_indexes=[155,156], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) [the ovaries](`laser_indexes=[157,158], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) are also really similar as they share like a [common ancestor](`laser_indexes=[159,160], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). And then it's [the B virus](`laser_indexes=[161,162], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). And [these ones](`laser_indexes=[163,164], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) are [more distant](`laser_indexes=[165,166], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`).

[(00:27:57)](`current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah I'm not sure about previous. I just the date of November 3 but here is also about date so I'm not sure.

[(00:28:07)](`current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`) Alice:  I guess the data collection ended in [November 3](`laser_indexes=[170,172], current_vis="CovidTypesGraph.jpg"`). Yeah. So it's.
