# Summary
1. **Napoleon's Russian Campaign Visualization Discussion**:
    - P5 and P6 discussed a map depicting Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign losses, noting the map's lack of clarity in representing geographical locations and the strategic error of attacking with less than a third of the force.
    - They observed the retreat path marked by a black line and speculated about a mysterious "tail" on the map, suggesting it might represent a detour by a contingent of the army.
    - The discussion highlighted the need for clearer indicators of direction and scale on the map.

2. **Analysis of Population Density and Segregation**:
    - The conversation shifted to analyzing maps showing population density and racial segregation in various U.S. cities and states.
    - They noted the stark contrast in population density across different regions, with the Midwest and the Rockies being particularly sparse.
    - The lingering effects of redlining were evident, especially in New York, and the discussion touched on the importance of farmland in sparsely populated states.
    - Referential gestures were used to point out specific areas of interest, such as Hurricane Alley, densely populated capitals, and areas of racial segregation in cities like Boston and Chicago.

3. **Climate Change Data Visualization Critique**:
    - P5 and P6 critiqued a graph depicting climate change data, expressing confusion over its design and potential for misinterpretation.
    - They discussed the graph's color scheme and curve, suggesting improvements for clarity and accessibility.
    - The conversation touched on the importance of clear data presentation, especially in conveying critical information like climate change trends.

4. **Hurricane Category Analysis**:
    - The discussion moved to analyzing hurricane categories and their increasing frequency and intensity.
    - P5 noted that while Category 3 hurricanes remained relatively constant, there was a noticeable increase in more severe Category 4 and 5 hurricanes.
    - P6 expressed a desire for clearer categorization of hurricane strength in the data presented.

5. **UN Report on Climate Change and Capitalism**:
    - P5 mentioned a UN report suggesting the dire need for systemic change to address climate change, critiquing the profitability of current environmental neglect.
    - P6 expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of repeated warnings without substantial action.

6. **Long-Term Climate Trends Analysis**:
    - The conversation concluded with a look at long-term climate trends, highlighting the importance of multi-year data to understand the bigger picture.
    - P5 pointed out an anomaly in the data for a specific year, sparking curiosity about the underlying cause.

# Transcript
P6:  So it says, part one. This map portrays the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the russian campaign of 1812. The thickness of the thick band shows the size of the army at each position. The path of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in the cold winter is depicted by the dark lower band, which is tied to the temperature and timescales. Discuss the key events of Williams march. You can discuss the type, location, timing, and cause of events.

P5:  The first thing that jumped out to me about this, first off, I didn't put together at first that these lines were superimposed on a map. So it would be really helpful if there was, like, country borders from it or something to indicate that this is the physical location as part of this visualization. The next thing that jumps out on me is, what the hell was he thinking, attacking the capitol with less than one third of his force?

P6:  That is true. I feel like it's hard to understand that this is a location, like a location map that I had to figure out that as well. Just by looking. It very was. Napoleon was retreating from the beginning for some reason, like some of his argument. That's weird.

P5:  No, I'm not sure what that little tail is. The black tail on the left hand side.

P6:  I think the black line is for the people who retreated. Right.

P5:  The black is for the retreat. But that little tail that shoots way up far on the left hand side, I have no idea what's going on there.

P6:  I think that's just the road they take or something.

P5:  Maybe. It looks like maybe a contingent went north and then came back down south and rejoiced. What was left of the main course right at the end would be helpful, too, showing the direction of travel.

P6:  I think the way the line goes is what they intended to portray where they're going, where the army is heading. But still, it's a little bit. Of course, it would be much more helpful if there were arrows and all that. Creature scale is also the thing I feel. It's just like. It's a lot of stuff in a small.

P5:  Yeah.

P6:  Do you feel anything more relevant? Or we can move to another slide.

P5:  Nothing else jumps out at me.

P6:  Okay, I think we can go ahead to the next one. Did it change for you as well?

P5:  Any patterns of how neighborhoods are segregated? Island. That's the prison where people have been dying a lot, if I remember correctly.

P6:  I see. Big thing is, of course that would be true as well, because the white people are majorly in the center of the state or the city.

P5:  Yeah, that's a different set on the. Okay, Salt Lake is actually.

P6:  Yeah. But I think Lake Salt Lake is not that densely populated in this.

P5:  That's true. It's not densely populated, but it's a little bit less obviously segregated than most of the other examples.

P6:  Yeah.

P5:  Which is interesting. You can definitely see the lingering effects of redlining. It's clear as day.

P6:  Yeah.

P5:  Especially in New York. Oh, my God. New York's also densely populated, as all.

P6:  Think. But this doesn't mention the year. Right? Or maybe I have not seen it.

P5:  Yeah, you're right. It doesn't mention the year. I can't imagine it's too old, but it would be good to know when it's from.

P6:  Yeah, I guess that would be more. Would help to figure out more about the things that is there.

P5:  It's from census data, so it's either at the newest, it's from 2020, but it could be older, I guess.

P6:  Yeah. By seeing this map of the whole United States, I just feel like how the density of population is so low.

P5:  Yeah. Most of the country has nobody in it.

P6:  Yeah. Most of the midwest is just like, empty.

P5:  Yeah. The Midwest and the Rockies especially. Yeah. The Sierra Nevada.

P6:  Nevada is mostly empty.

P5:  And then a fat ton of people live in Phoenix where it routinely reaches, like 110 degrees for some reason.

P6:  Yeah. Washington is pretty empty as well. I went to Seattle a couple of times, but I didn't realize, like, Washington was not densely populated as well. Other than Seattle, of.

P5:  Yeah. Yeah. Basically nowhere in the US is densely populated unless you're near a major. That. That belt from Boston down through New York, through Philadelphia to DC. But outside of that and the major cities, it's almost empty.

P6:  Yeah, exactly. Next thing I want to discuss was, like, these states, which are mostly empty, are very important farmlands.

P5:  Yeah. So the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, a lot of farmlands. I think Iowa, too. And then further west of that you have the Rockies. And it's kind of hard to live in the. I mean, I like mountains, but it's hard to build in the mountains, especially infrastructure and roads and stuff.

P6:  I think Wyoming is very evenly distributed for some reason. I think it looks the most clean and evenly.

P5:  Nobody lives there. Also, the quarter of the state is Yellowstone National park.

P6:  Right. That's true.

P6:  C Just a reminder that you can communicate with each other using the laser pen to direct attention, et cetera, with the cities especially, are not familiar with it.

P6:  A lot of people I was thinking of [lives there](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). Even [lake](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) is very like. I think there's a cyclone and hurricane every other year.

P5:  Yeah. A lot of people live down [here](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`) in Hurricane Alley.

P6:  I think they are just learned to live with [that](`laser_indexes=[3], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`) and all that.

P5:  Yeah, I think it's a lot of ires that came down for the [nice weather](`laser_indexes=[4], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`) and the beaches.

P6:  I think most of [the capitals](`laser_indexes=[5], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) are [populated](`laser_indexes=[6], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), which it should be, but, like, [not in](`laser_indexes=[7], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`).

P5:  Well, [Chicago](`laser_indexes=[8], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`) is not the capital of [Illinois](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`).

P6:  Yeah, but it could be the way it's populated. I think we can.

P5:  The next task. This one?

P6:  No, I think we can look in the city maps.

P5:  Yeah.

P6:  I think Boston is very nicely segregated. It's like [just](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`).

P5:  [South Boston](`laser_indexes=[11,12], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`).

P6:  This [area](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`) is like [North Boston](`laser_indexes=[14], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) is.

P5:  Almost all white people and South Boston is almost [devoid of them](`laser_indexes=[15], current_vis="TUS.jpg"`).

P6:  I don't know what's going in [this area](`laser_indexes=[16], current_vis="SLC.jpg"`) because it's mix of colors other than [green](`laser_indexes=[17], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`).

P5:  Mostly [the Hispanics](`laser_indexes=[18], current_vis="Boston.jpg"`). There's like [a line](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="LosA.jpg"`). All the white people are on one side of the line.

P6:  Yeah.

P5:  Chicago.

P6:  [Chicago](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) has died.

P5:  And then [this](`laser_indexes=[22,23], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`). And then this is mostly hispanic people [up in here](`laser_indexes=[22,23,24], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`). [This](`laser_indexes=[25,26,27], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) especially.

P6:  And basically like [this coastline](`laser_indexes=[28], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`).

P5:  Yeah, [coastline](`laser_indexes=[29], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) seems to be where the white people like to congregate.

P6:  But I think this is like the bridge, which expensive area.

P5:  Yeah.

P6:  But this is like [very clear](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`), [separate line](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`), isn't it? Because I see very less mixture of blue in [here](`laser_indexes=[31], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) and very less mixture [line](`laser_indexes=[32,33], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`).

P5:  Yeah, [here](`laser_indexes=[34], current_vis="Chicago.jpg"`) as well.

P6:  Much more depth.

P5:  Central park.

P6:  Yeah. Because I think that it's super expensive, [super high](`laser_indexes=[38], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`).

P5:  There's [Central park](`laser_indexes=[39], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) where no one lives, and then all the [6,000 a month apartment](`laser_indexes=[40], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). I don't actually know how much they cost, but they're expensive as fuck.

P6:  [Here](`laser_indexes=[41], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). You can see it's a good place to live. I think it's [very close](`laser_indexes=[41], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`), but it's clearly segregated in [this particular area](`laser_indexes=[42], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`). And the doctor clearly [segregated](`laser_indexes=[43,44], current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) as well. I think we can move on to other tasks, right?

P5:  Probably, yeah. [Departure from](`laser_indexes=[45], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`).

P6:  I'm not very clear what this map is.

P5:  Yeah, this is a weird visualization, I think as the lines go from yellow to red, which is an interesting choice of colors, I would have done like, blue to yellow or something. Yellow to red is going to be especially for colorblind people. But even if you're not, yellow is still half red. Interesting.

P6:  And I don't understand the need for a curve here. It just confuses because my first thinking was it was going up, up, and then it started to fall down. I think many people.

P5:  Yeah, a lot of people are going to misinterpret this as, oh, the temperature is [getting better](`laser_indexes=[46], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), [2020](`laser_indexes=[47], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) is [over here](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). No, that's not what it means. That's not at all what it means. [Left to right](`laser_indexes=[49], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) is for one year, apparently. It looks like, so, like [January](`laser_indexes=[50], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), [July](`laser_indexes=[51,52], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), and then clearly getting [warmer](`laser_indexes=[53,54], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) and [warmer](`laser_indexes=[55,56], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) and [warmer](`laser_indexes=[57,58], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) if you spend a few seconds figuring out how to read the graph.

P6:  Yeah. But I think I feel like graph should be crystal clear and we are so much more. We shouldn't have to discuss about it.

P5:  Yeah. This is the kind of graph that I would expect to see someone on Fox News take out a [dog type deal](`laser_indexes=[59], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), just like, [see the general shape](`laser_indexes=[60], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) and be like, [yeah](`laser_indexes=[61], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). I [don't know](`laser_indexes=[62], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). That make you confused, but it definitely has that effect. Someone can definitely end up taking the wrong message from it, even writing an article on it, either just mistakenly just because they read the graph wrong, or maliciously because they're trying to mislead people. And this would be a very good graph with which to do that because it's technically correct, but could easily be [misinterpreted](`laser_indexes=[63], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), especially as incorrectly presented to give the exact wrong impression.

P6:  And for some reason it says [1982 at 15](`laser_indexes=[64], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`), but it still shows 2020 data. I don't know [why is that](`laser_indexes=[65], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`)?

P5:  I think the colors are 2020 [over here](`laser_indexes=[66], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) on the [right end of the graph](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`).

P6:  [Yeah](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). And it says, like [80 here](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). And it says [18](`laser_indexes=[69], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`).

P5:  [Yeah](`laser_indexes=[70], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`). What the heck? Is this like [the average](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`) for. [Average](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`)? Is that the average for that year or is that like the average over [that entire time period](`laser_indexes=[72], current_vis="SeasonalTemp.jpg"`)?

P6:  Yeah, I would not like to.

P5:  No, definitely not want to move on?

P6:  Yeah.

P5:  Okay. Think rolling. Average. Yeah. Because you're getting a [lot more of them](`laser_indexes=[73], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), and we're also getting a lot more of [the big ones](`laser_indexes=[73], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), like [this cat four](`laser_indexes=[74], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Cat five window is where most the expansion is occurring.

P6:  Might sound right, but the quantity of quality of new targeted later.

P5:  Yeah, it's almost like [cat three](`laser_indexes=[75], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) has almost remained relatively [constant](`laser_indexes=[76], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). It's like we're getting more hurricanes and the new ones are the strongest type. Doubly bad.

P6:  But I think it would have been good if they had. What cat is kind of [has it](`laser_indexes=[77], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

P5:  [Here](`laser_indexes=[78], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) over x miles per hour.

P6:  But, yeah, this is a pain in a holding knowledge. I'm getting depressed about the names and everything.

P5:  Has to do. The Un recently came out with a report that said something to the effect. I mean, not as directly because it's the UN, but basically the report stated, we're boned unless revolution, unless we get rid of capitalism.

P6:  I just feel like they have been saying it for [so many years](`laser_indexes=[79], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), the only thing they've been able to do is [fail](`laser_indexes=[80], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

P5:  It's not [profitable](`laser_indexes=[81], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) to actually [do anything](`laser_indexes=[82], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) about it. It's more profitable to [keep up with](`laser_indexes=[83], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

P6:  Yeah. Okay.

P5:  Active fire. Hot. It just. In 2020, kind of hard to just showing one year's worth of data doesn't really tell you anything about long term trends in the climate. Here it is, [2001 to 2019 average](`laser_indexes=[84], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). I see. Okay.

P6:  I remember what's happening in [January](`laser_indexes=[85], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

P5:  Yes. [The heck happened here](`laser_indexes=[86], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`)? This actually, overall seems to be [less than normal](`laser_indexes=[87], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), but except for [whatever](`laser_indexes=[88], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) the.

P6:  Hell happened here, you see, like, all this. Yeah.
