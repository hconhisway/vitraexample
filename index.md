# Summary
## Introduction and Overview of Discussion

Alice initiated the conversation by emphasizing the importance of understanding the context first. 

Bob inquired whether they should vocalize the content they were reviewing, suggesting a preference for reading the material out loud to facilitate discussion.

Alice clarified that vocalization might not be necessary, proposing instead that they first read the description silently to themselves. She summarized the content, which instructed them to analyze the key events of a historical march, focusing on aspects such as the type of events, their locations, timings, and underlying causes. Alice confirmed the approach of reviewing the description before proceeding with their discussion.

## Initial Analysis of Map and Army Movements

Bob confirmed his agreement with the direction of the conversation.

Alice then reflected on the visual representation, noting it depicted the fluctuation in the size of Napoleon's army as it advanced towards Moscow and subsequently diminished upon its return. She suggested that the visual indicated a back-and-forth movement regarding the army's size.

Bob concurred, pointing out that [the thickness of the visual representation](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) appeared to directly correlate with [the size of the army](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), indicating that as the army's size decreased, so did the thickness of the band on the visual representation. He also mentioned that the visual seemed to show branches, implying different paths or divisions within the army.

Alice inquired if these branches represented different routes taken by the army or if they had another significance.

Bob clarified that his interpretation was that these were indeed [branches](`laser_indexes=[4], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or [divisions within the army](`laser_indexes=[5], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), perhaps indicating different corps or detachments splitting off from the main force.

Alice expressed a desire to understand [the descriptions](`laser_indexes=[7], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) provided on the visual more clearly, noting her previous familiarity with the map but acknowledging that her memory of its details had faded.

Bob, having seen the visual representation recently and twice in the past year, felt confident in his familiarity with it.

Alice requested Bob to provide a detailed explanation of the visual representation, seeking to understand the events and movements it depicted.

Bob began his explanation by pointing out the starting point of the march and highlighting [the main force's advance up to Moscow](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). He mentioned that the army suffered losses not only due to weather conditions but also from battles encountered along the way.

Alice sought clarification on a specific part of the visual, pointing out [a branch](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and a black line indicating a [march](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), wondering about its significance.

Bob referred back to the earlier discussion, explaining that the black line represented [the retreat](`laser_indexes=[12], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) from [Moscow, depicted in the dark lower band](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), indicating the path taken during the army's withdrawal.

Bob concluded this part of the discussion by mentioning the return path, which led [back through forests](`laser_indexes=[14], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) towards [Paris or another destination](`laser_indexes=[15,16], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), marking the end of the campaign's visual representation.

## Further Exploration of Map Details

Alice acknowledged Bob's suggestion to shift their analysis towards Lithuania. Bob explained that upon reaching [a certain location](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), a branch of soldiers was forced to [retreat](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) back west. Alice connected this movement to the [thickness of the band](`laser_indexes=[22], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) on their visual representation, surmising that it indicated soldiers returning from [a specific area](`laser_indexes=[23], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), thereby explaining the presence of the entire army in that region.

Alice speculated about the [number of soldiers](`laser_indexes=[25], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) involved in this movement, suggesting there might be a significant amount. Bob noted that Mark's observations were [slightly off](`laser_indexes=[28], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), but acknowledged her interest and enthusiasm in the topic.

Alice inquired about the significance of [a body of water](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) depicted on their visual aid, to which Bob responded that it was merely a minor detail. Alice then questioned whether there was any correlation between the army's movements and [the temperature](`laser_indexes=[34], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), implying that the section of the visual representation they were discussing corresponded to temperature variations.

## Temperature and Soldier Losses

Bob highlighted an unintuitive aspect of the visual representation, specifically pointing out the dates [October 18](`laser_indexes=[36], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and [November 9](`laser_indexes=[37], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), which progressed in [a certain direction](`laser_indexes=[38,39], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). He noted that the temperatures were recorded in [decimal Celsius](`laser_indexes=[41,42,43], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), emphasizing the range from zero degrees down to [negative 38 degrees Celsius](`laser_indexes=[46,47], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), suggesting extreme cold conditions during this period.

Alice, trying to grasp the significance of these observations, noticed a [significant loss of soldiers](`laser_indexes=[49,50], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) at [a specific position](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), starting from [a point where](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) the army's size notably diminished. She questioned whether this loss was attributable to the lower temperatures experienced.

Bob considered the correlation between temperature and the army's retreat, suggesting that the losses during the advance might not solely be due to the cold but could also involve attrition from the march or skirmishes. Alice agreed, understanding that the direction of their return, marked by [a forward direction](`laser_indexes=[56], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) and [coming back](`laser_indexes=[57], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), saw a reduction in the army's size, likely influenced by decreasing temperatures.

Bob also observed significant events at [some river crossings](`laser_indexes=[61], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), which Alice acknowledged, noting a lack of notable changes [in certain areas](`laser_indexes=[64], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), possibly due to their proximity to the destination. However, she recognized a pattern in [a specific direction](`laser_indexes=[65], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), where encounters with rivers, such as [at these points](`laser_indexes=[68,69,70], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`), led to a [drop in the number of soldiers](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). This pattern was more pronounced during their return as lower temperatures in [this direction](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) correlated with [significant drops in soldier numbers](`laser_indexes=[72,73], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

Concluding their analysis, Alice suggested that the visual representation's lines, indicating temperature drops, might not provide [as interesting insights](`laser_indexes=[66,67], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) as initially thought, proposing to move on to [another chart](`laser_indexes=[70,71,72], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) for further examination, to which Bob agreed, indicating readiness to proceed.

## Transition to Analyzing Modern Data Visualizations

Bob acknowledged Alice's suggestion to examine one of the maps for further analysis. Alice, however, expressed difficulty in interpreting the charts due to illegible text and proposed selecting a different one, to which Bob agreed enthusiastically.

Alice then identified a feature on the map, referring to it as [the seven-day rolling average](`laser_indexes=[77], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), which Bob confirmed. Alice pointed out an orange line on the map, indicating it represented a hotspot. Bob shared his feeling of being [stranded](`laser_indexes=[80], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) due to the overwhelming data.

The discussion shifted towards the purpose of including the [rolling average](`laser_indexes=[81], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), which Alice believed was to highlight a [global trend](`laser_indexes=[82], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). She expressed uncertainty about interpreting a [long-term trend](`laser_indexes=[84], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in global temperature due to the absence of [labels](`laser_indexes=[87], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) on [this axis](`laser_indexes=[85], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), making it unclear what the axis represented.

Bob speculated that [this](`laser_indexes=[88], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) aspect of the map was related to [fire](`laser_indexes=[89], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), aligning with Alice's observation that an area marked [here](`laser_indexes=[90], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) indicated above-average fire incidents. Alice agreed, noting that the quantity seemed excessive for a single month.

Bob expressed alarm at the potential implications if their interpretation was accurate, mentioning Russia's vulnerability due to a high number of foreigners in Siberia. Alice specified the timeframe from [June to September](`laser_indexes=[93], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), during which over [4,000](`laser_indexes=[94], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) incidents were recorded, underscoring the severity of the situation.

Bob marveled at the [average](`laser_indexes=[96], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), pondering its significance in the context of climate change, while acknowledging his own biases. Alice suggested that by [looking at trends](`laser_indexes=[97,98], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), particularly the daily data excluding the black line which represented the 2020 active average, they could gain insights into the broader implications of their observations.

## Discussion on Global Temperature and Ice Coverage Trends

Bob noted a distinction in [the timing](`laser_indexes=[100], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) of seasons between [Russia](`laser_indexes=[101], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), [the United States](`laser_indexes=[102], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), which experience their prime seasons differently from [Australia](`laser_indexes=[103], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), where [the summer](`laser_indexes=[104,105], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) occurs at an opposite time. This discrepancy in seasons could potentially influence the data being analyzed.

Alice concurred with Bob's observation and added that the data for 2020, identified as [the active hotspot](`laser_indexes=[109], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), appeared distinct from previous years. This divergence suggested a significant change, particularly for Australia, where [the actual 2020 data](`laser_indexes=[111], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) differed markedly from [previous data](`laser_indexes=[112,113], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). She noted a pattern where the data initially showed a decrease but then followed a [seven-day rolling average](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) that increased before eventually [decreasing](`laser_indexes=[118], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), yet maintained a somewhat consistent pattern. In Russia's case, the data closely followed [the trend](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), with the seven-day average aligning well with [the overall pattern](`laser_indexes=[122], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

Bob remarked on something [notable](`laser_indexes=[123], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), pointing out that a specific event occurred [earlier](`laser_indexes=[125], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) than [expected](`laser_indexes=[126], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). Alice agreed, highlighting an anomaly in the United States' data, where a peak appeared unexpectedly in contrast to the [previous data](`laser_indexes=[129,130], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), which had been relatively stable. This peak was considered a significant [signal](`laser_indexes=[131], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

Bob mentioned the absence of direct references to [global temperatures](`laser_indexes=[132], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) or [climate change](`laser_indexes=[133], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in their current analysis. Alice observed that in Australia, [the change](`laser_indexes=[134], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) was significant and did not [follow the trend](`laser_indexes=[135], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) as closely as other regions. While Russia showed some consistency despite changes, the United States exhibited a relatively constant pattern, barring [a specific anomaly](`laser_indexes=[137], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

Bob speculated whether Australia's lower data point [here](`laser_indexes=[138], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) could indicate recovery from [a previous spike](`laser_indexes=[139,140], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`), though he admitted this was purely speculative, given his lack of expertise in wildfire management. Alice expressed similar uncertainty, suggesting that removing [an anomalous data point](`laser_indexes=[143], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) could potentially align the pattern more closely with previous trends.

Alice pondered whether a [scaling factor](`laser_indexes=[144], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) could explain the data, but was unsure of [the number's](`laser_indexes=[145], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) significance. Bob questioned whether the value represented temperature, quickly dismissing the idea due to the context. Alice concluded their discussion, proposing they move on to another visual representation for further analysis, to which Bob agreed, emphasizing the importance of interpretability in their next selection.

## Analysis of Hurricane and Cyclone Data

Bob remarked that the issue under discussion was essentially the same as before, with Alice agreeing and noting that the [global temperature](`laser_indexes=[146], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) also presented similar challenges. Bob speculated that the data might pertain to [climate indicators](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), covering an area of [610 square kilometers](`laser_indexes=[150], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), which he later corrected to [millions of square kilometers](`laser_indexes=[152], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), possibly encompassing [multiple cities](`laser_indexes=[153], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

Alice expressed a personal preference against certain scales, finding them fancy but problematic due to missing values, which complicates interpretation. She highlighted the importance of having a [significant marker](`laser_indexes=[155], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) for clarity. Bob pointed out the zero mark's position, and Alice criticized the timeline stopping at October without clear continuation to December, which she assumed would be [indicated here](`laser_indexes=[165], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), guessing [the start of the new year](`laser_indexes=[166], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) might be [in this area](`laser_indexes=[167,168], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

Bob suggested the peculiar placement indicated January, leading Alice to acknowledge the sense in his observation. They discussed the color scale, with Alice noting that the lighter green indicated older data and [the blue lines](`laser_indexes=[170], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) represented more recent data or different data points. Bob observed a trend in global temperature, with darker shades indicating lower values as one moves [downward](`laser_indexes=[173,174], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), suggesting a decrease in [ICE coverage](`laser_indexes=[175], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

Alice and Bob discussed the trend of ICE coverage, noting it generally appeared lower, starting from [the same point](`laser_indexes=[178], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) but decreasing significantly. Bob explained that in [April](`laser_indexes=[180], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), there were approximately [15 million square kilometers](`laser_indexes=[181,182], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) of ICE, which has decreased over time, showing a fluctuation with gains in ICE from January to February, but a drop from January to April.

Alice summarized that this pattern indicated a seasonal nature, with Bob agreeing and noting the [massive change](`laser_indexes=[198], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) observed. Alice speculated on the [overall drop](`laser_indexes=[199], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`), suggesting a periodic but consistently downward trend, indicative of climate change and a decrease in ICE coverage, likely due to rising global temperatures.

Agreeing on their interpretation, Alice suggested moving to another chart, offering to select the next visual for analysis. They decided to examine a bar chart detailing hurricanes and cyclones with maximum sustained winds over 110 mph from 1950 to 2020, which they identified as another piece of climate change data, pointing out [the average line](`laser_indexes=[204], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

## Further Insights into Storm Categorization and Trends

Bob began the discussion by detailing his method of visual analysis, mentioning his approach to overlaying cuts [five](`laser_indexes=[205], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and [three](`laser_indexes=[206,207], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) to color the light in [purple](`laser_indexes=[208,209], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Alice acknowledged his statement, indicating her understanding and agreement.

Bob then introduced the concept of [Category three](`laser_indexes=[211], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), prompting Alice to reflect on the visual representation, noting that darker colors indicated more severe trends. She expressed uncertainty about how to relate a specific [trend line](`laser_indexes=[215], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) to the dataset, suggesting a need for further examination.

Bob clarified that the trend line represented an average over ten years, mentioning [rolling averages](`laser_indexes=[218], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and their relevance to the discussion. Alice compared this to COVID data, explaining how averages from the 1960s to the 1970s were calculated and then interpolated to present different lines, indicating a method of averaging over [these years](`laser_indexes=[220,221], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

The conversation shifted to whether the data from 1970 correlated to [the previous](`laser_indexes=[224], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) decade's average or if it was a combination of [five plus the previous five years](`laser_indexes=[226], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Alice found the question intriguing, while Bob tried to recall the specific methodology used.

Alice shared her understanding of averaging data, particularly in the context of COVID, where she described a process of canceling previous data up to a certain point and then calculating [the average](`laser_indexes=[229], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Bob questioned how one would average [future data](`laser_indexes=[231], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) that wasn't yet available, to which Alice suggested that the analysis likely focused on [previous data](`laser_indexes=[232], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and [rolling averages](`laser_indexes=[233], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

The discussion then moved to the representation of data through colors, with Alice pondering the granularity of [these colors](`laser_indexes=[241], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and what they represented in terms of [different categories](`laser_indexes=[242], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and daily data on [storms](`laser_indexes=[244], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Bob clarified that the data was presented [per year](`laser_indexes=[248,249], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), indicating a certain number of category three storms annually, with a total of [eleven storms](`laser_indexes=[252], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) being represented.

Alice likened the visual representation to a stack bar chart, a comparison Bob agreed with, confirming her interpretation. The discussion then explored the possibility of the data being presented on a monthly basis due to a [huge gap](`laser_indexes=[255], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), but Bob clarified it was likely yearly, with significant jumps between decades, such as from the 1960s to [1980](`laser_indexes=[259], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

Alice reflected on the progression from [1960](`laser_indexes=[261], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) to [1970](`laser_indexes=[262], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`), noting the ten-year intervals between data points and observing an increase in category [glor storm](`laser_indexes=[263], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) occurrences over time. Bob mentioned the difficulty in distinguishing a proportional increase in category five storms, while Alice noted the lack of a definitive global pattern but observed more immediate purple color in certain areas, indicating an increase in [category five](`laser_indexes=[266], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) storms.

Bob focused on [category three](`laser_indexes=[270-274]`) storms, observing a potential increase in severity over time, while Alice saw [distant numbers](`laser_indexes=[282], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and a general increase in [category three](`laser_indexes=[281], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) occurrences, though not significantly.

The conversation concluded with Bob and Alice discussing the overall frequency and strength of storms, pondering whether there was an increase in storm frequency or strength based on the visual data presented. Alice suggested that the chart primarily provided numbers within each storm category per year, leaving some questions about storm frequency and strength unanswered.

# Transcript
[(00:00:00)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Description first.

[(00:00:12)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Should we be reading it out loud?

[(00:00:18)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  I guess we don't have to. Yeah I'm just guessing that we can read the description first and then probably discuss. So it says discuss the key events of nipple march. You can discuss the type location timing and causes of events. Right okay.

[(00:00:37)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah absolutely.

[(00:00:49)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay so I guess the first part about this is it kind of shows back and forth. Right. Like the size of the army going to Moscow. And then the size of it reduces when they come back from here. Right?

[(00:01:04)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah. It seems like [the thickness of it](`laser_indexes=[1], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) is correlated to [the size of the army](`laser_indexes=[2], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Branches off.

[(00:01:11)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah. So are these like different paths that they took branch out and then.

[(00:01:19)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  So my interpretation is these are just [branching](`laser_indexes=[4], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) like [splitting off](`laser_indexes=[5], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:01:26)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay cool. I'm just trying to read [those description](`laser_indexes=[7], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) a little bit better. Yeah I've seen this map before but it was like years ago so I forgot.

[(00:01:40)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah I've seen it twice in the last year so I feel very familiar with it at the moment.

[(00:01:45)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay perfect. Then you can walk me through this. Give me rundown. What's going on?

[(00:01:51)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Okay. Yeah so this is where they started marching. And this is [the main force up to Moscow](`laser_indexes=[9], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). The army had losses entirely due to weather or there was also battles I think the robotics.

[(00:02:17)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah. Do you know what this means? Basically? So there's [this branch right here](`laser_indexes=[10], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Right. And there's this black line shows that there's a [merch](`laser_indexes=[11], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:02:29)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yes. So going back to the description above there was [the retreat](`laser_indexes=[12], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). [Moscow in the dark lower](`laser_indexes=[13], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:02:41)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:02:43)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  And that's when the black is the black. [Back to forest](`laser_indexes=[14], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). [Paris](`laser_indexes=[15], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) wherever [this is](`laser_indexes=[16], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:02:53)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:02:55)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Lithuania.

[(00:02:59)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:03:04)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Once this branch of soldiers got [here](`laser_indexes=[19], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) they ended up [retreat](`laser_indexes=[20], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) back west.

[(00:03:12)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay. That kind of explains [this thickness right here](`laser_indexes=[22], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). I guess we have some soldiers coming back from [here](`laser_indexes=[23], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). And then we have this entire army. So that's why. Okay cool.

[(00:03:28)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Just.

[(00:03:33)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  I guess like some of them like there's like [number of soldiers](`laser_indexes=[25], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) to them too right?

[(00:03:42)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Mark's [slightly off](`laser_indexes=[28], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). She's [fancy too](`laser_indexes=[29], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). She's interested.

[(00:03:47)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah. Do you know what does [this water](`laser_indexes=[30], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) or like?

[(00:03:55)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  I think it's just a rare.

[(00:03:57)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay cool it.

[(00:04:03)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Bet. Hardly.

[(00:04:11)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  So do you see any correlation with [the temperature](`laser_indexes=[34], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`)? I guess this entire portion is the temperature part right?

[(00:04:20)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah. And something that is unintuitive about [this](`laser_indexes=[35], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). [October 18](`laser_indexes=[36], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) [November 9](`laser_indexes=[37], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So these are going forward in [this direction](`laser_indexes=[38,39], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:04:31)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay. Yeah.

[(00:04:35)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  The temperatures are [decimal](`laser_indexes=[41], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). There's also [Celsius](`laser_indexes=[42,43], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:04:45)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay got you.

[(00:04:46)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Sort of like it was [below reason](`laser_indexes=[44], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) the entire time. [Top R](`laser_indexes=[45], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) it was zero degrees Celsius. And all the way down to [negative 38 Celsius](`laser_indexes=[46,47], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:05:01)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay. I'm trying to understand if you notice in [this position](`laser_indexes=[48], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) there is a [significant loss](`laser_indexes=[49,50], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) of soldiers. Right. Starting from [here](`laser_indexes=[51], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) it's very low here. I wonder why that there. Is it because of the lower temperature?

[(00:05:25)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  I'm not sure. Because. Yeah I think the temperature correlation is to [the retreat](`laser_indexes=[52], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) not to [the advance](`laser_indexes=[53], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:05:33)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:05:34)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  And so I'm not sure what the losses are on [the advance](`laser_indexes=[54], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) whether it's just attrition due to unmarsh or if it's like fighting skirmishing or something.

[(00:05:48)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah that makes sense because you said this is [forward direction](`laser_indexes=[56], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Right. Like while [coming back](`laser_indexes=[57], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:05:56)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah.

[(00:05:59)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  I guess the temperature is kind of [lowering](`laser_indexes=[59], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) as we proceed in [this direction](`laser_indexes=[60], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) which is why when soldiers were coming back we can see the width of this line is like going lower because of the temperature. Right? Yeah absolutely.

[(00:06:16)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  And that also something I just noticed is at [some river crossings](`laser_indexes=[61], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:06:24)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Yeah I don't really notice much [here](`laser_indexes=[64], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) but I guess that's because they're closer to the destination. Sure.

[(00:06:35)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah.

[(00:06:40)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  I guess we can see that in [this direction](`laser_indexes=[65], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) too. Like in [here](`laser_indexes=[66], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) there's a little bit of [drop](`laser_indexes=[67], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). While there are. Whenever there's an encounter with rivers like [here](`laser_indexes=[68], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) there's like a [drop](`laser_indexes=[69,70], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) number of soldiers. And while coming back the temperature as the temperature was lower in [this direction](`laser_indexes=[71], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) whenever there was [significant drop](`laser_indexes=[72], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) we had [less amount of soldiers](`laser_indexes=[73], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). Yeah I guess [these lines](`laser_indexes=[75], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) are just like pointing towards those temperature drops. But yeah I guess they compare from that. I don't really see [that interesting](`laser_indexes=[66,67], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) in [this chart](`laser_indexes=[68,69], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`). So should we move to [another chart](`laser_indexes=[70,71,72], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`)? [Sure](`laser_indexes=[73,74,75], current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`).

[(00:07:33)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Bob:  Yeah.

[(00:07:33)](`current_vis="1920px-Minard_Update.png"`) Alice:  Okay perfect. Let's take a look at one of these map. That will look.

[(00:07:43)](`current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah.

[(00:07:45)](`current_vis="newYork.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay. Yes. That's another thing like for the charts I can't really read stuff written in the charts. We can pick another one.

[(00:08:05)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah that's great. Yeah. Fantastic.

[(00:08:09)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Um average. Yes. It's like [the seven day rolling average](`laser_indexes=[77], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) I guess.

[(00:08:41)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Oh yes that's right here.

[(00:08:44)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  And then this orange line is basically the hotspot.

[(00:08:49)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. So that's why I'm [stranded](`laser_indexes=[80], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:08:54)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah.

[(00:08:56)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  There are a lot of duress.

[(00:08:58)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  I guess the point of adding this [rolling average](`laser_indexes=[81], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is just to point towards the [global trend](`laser_indexes=[82], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) because it says here that. Can you analyze any [long term trend](`laser_indexes=[84], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in global temperature? I'm not really sure what [this axis](`laser_indexes=[85], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) actually [because](`laser_indexes=[86], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) it doesn't really have any [label](`laser_indexes=[87], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:09:40)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  True. My assumption was that [this](`laser_indexes=[88], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) was all just to do with [fire](`laser_indexes=[89], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:09:50)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. Like the average incident. Because in [here](`laser_indexes=[90], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) it's just like above average fire meetings. So I guess it's like number of considered.

[(00:10:00)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  [That's probably](`laser_indexes=[91], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:10:04)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Right. Yeah. That seems like [a lot though](`laser_indexes=[92], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) for a month or so.

[(00:10:10)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Oh yeah. That's terrifying. If the interpretation is correct Russia has a lot of foreigners in Siberia but still.

[(00:10:17)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah it's like for a single month I'm guessing from [June to September](`laser_indexes=[93], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) this is not that much time that we have over [4k](`laser_indexes=[94], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) as well.

[(00:10:28)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. I mean like their average [right here](`laser_indexes=[96], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). It's incredible to average. What does this mean as far as temperature climate change? I have my biases that I can assume things on.

[(00:10:41)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. In terms of if we try to [look at trends](`laser_indexes=[97,98], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) these are daily. Right. Apart from the black line it says like 2020 active average.

[(00:11:04)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  I guess one thing I noticed [the timing](`laser_indexes=[100], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is different. [Russia](`laser_indexes=[101], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) and [the United States](`laser_indexes=[102], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) are more than premier whereas [Australia](`laser_indexes=[103], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is [the summer](`laser_indexes=[104], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). So [the summer](`laser_indexes=[105], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) would disagree with summer.

[(00:11:19)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  That makes sense. Yeah. And the other thing I just noticed is like [the timing](`laser_indexes=[108], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). So 2020 is like [the active hotspot](`laser_indexes=[109], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) but rolling is like a different data. It's like previous data.

[(00:11:30)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. The [black](`laser_indexes=[110], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is being speculative.

[(00:11:35)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes. In terms of Australia we definitely see [the actual 2020 data](`laser_indexes=[111], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is very much different than [previous data](`laser_indexes=[112,113], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). So something might change because even in [here](`laser_indexes=[114], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) you can see [lower](`laser_indexes=[115], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) compared to how it started. But with the seven day rolling average it is kind of like [increasing](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) and then it [decreases](`laser_indexes=[118], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). But it does follow like a little bit of [same pattern](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). This kind of has that bossier. For Russia it kind of follows [the trend](`laser_indexes=[117], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) pretty well. Right. Because the seven day average is like following [this pattern](`laser_indexes=[118], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) and we kind of see [similar pattern](`laser_indexes=[119], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in terms of [the orange line](`laser_indexes=[120], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) [here](`laser_indexes=[121], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) there are significant incidents but kind of following [the overall pattern](`laser_indexes=[122], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:12:29)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  I guess the one thing that seems maybe [notable](`laser_indexes=[123], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is that [this](`laser_indexes=[124], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) is a little bit [earlier](`laser_indexes=[125], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) than [expected](`laser_indexes=[126], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:12:36)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes. Yeah that's true. I see that. Yeah. For United States I would say this is just like an anomaly at least [this peak](`laser_indexes=[128], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) for me because [previous data](`laser_indexes=[129,130], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) was pretty much constant. If you take like a moving average this is kind of like a constant trend. But for whatever reason just after September October which is also weird because in October you don't need to go. That's [a signal](`laser_indexes=[131], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). I guess that's pretty much what I understand from the same.

[(00:13:32)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. I don't see anything directly stating anything about [global temperatures](`laser_indexes=[132], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) [river climate change](`laser_indexes=[133], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:13:39)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes. I guess the only thing that I can say is in terms of Australia [the change is significant](`laser_indexes=[134], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) in a way because it didn't really [follow the trend](`laser_indexes=[135], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) that well. For Russia it seemed to be a little bit more consistent although there are changes but that's also a little crazy. But for United States it's also pretty constant. But then we have [this right here](`laser_indexes=[137], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`).

[(00:14:16)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  The only thing I can really wonder Australia if [this lower right here](`laser_indexes=[138], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) being lower than normal is the system recovering from [this spike](`laser_indexes=[139,140], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`)?

[(00:14:26)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  I don't know.

[(00:14:27)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  It's just complete speculation. I know nothing about wildfire management.

[(00:14:32)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah same. And this is [another thing](`laser_indexes=[141], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). I feel like if this is like [an anomaly](`laser_indexes=[142], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) and you just take out [this data point](`laser_indexes=[143], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) there's possibility that whatever this pattern is going to be is going to match the previous pattern right totally.

[(00:14:49)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. That's a good point.

[(00:14:50)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Can be like a [scaling factor](`laser_indexes=[144], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`). I'm really not sure what [the number](`laser_indexes=[145], current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) actually meant.

[(00:14:59)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Value or is it temperature? No it wouldn't be because 4000 blood.

[(00:15:07)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Exactly. Oh yeah exactly. Either way everybody does. But yeah but yeah I guess that's pretty much it that I. Should we move to another one?

[(00:15:25)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah.

[(00:15:26)](`current_vis="FIrehotspot.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay. He choose one? Yeah. Good. Interpretable.

[(00:15:39)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  If you can read everything there.

[(00:15:41)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes I can read everything here.

[(00:15:46)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  The prompt is effectively the same.

[(00:15:48)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay. So it's also like [global temperature](`laser_indexes=[146], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) kind of have the same issue [here](`laser_indexes=[146], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). Yeah.

[(00:16:02)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  I'm assuming it's probably [ci](`laser_indexes=[149], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). [610 square kilometers](`laser_indexes=[150], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:16:10)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:16:11)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  [Millions of square kilometers](`laser_indexes=[152], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). That's probably [multiple cities](`laser_indexes=[153], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:16:15)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay. Yes. That makes sense. I just want to [point out](`laser_indexes=[154], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) something else but this is like a personal preference thing. I don't like scales like this. They probably look like fancy or whatever but it's like the missing values. It just makes things harder. At least more on interpretation. Not too bad. Or like at least. Yeah at least a [big tick](`laser_indexes=[155], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:16:48)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Oh the zero is all the way. All the way over here.

[(00:16:51)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah.

[(00:16:52)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Left of the.

[(00:16:54)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  And at the same time it just stops at October. I don't get it. So there should be.

[(00:17:01)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  December would be [right here](`laser_indexes=[165], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:17:05)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah presumably. But I guess it says [new year here](`laser_indexes=[166], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). So I'm guessing [this is January](`laser_indexes=[167,168], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). So I could be wrong.

[(00:17:14)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Well the reason I'm saying summer is because of this weird thing over here.

[(00:17:18)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Where?

[(00:17:19)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  January.

[(00:17:20)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah that makes sense.

[(00:17:24)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  But you're absolutely right. It is a little bit typical temperature.

[(00:17:29)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. Okay. So the color scale basically means that the lighter the green is the older they are and [the blue lines](`laser_indexes=[170], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) are like [more](`laser_indexes=[171], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). [Right](`laser_indexes=[172], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:17:43)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. So I can see more trends in global temperature quite a bit immediately. Just because then it gets darker as you go [down](`laser_indexes=[173,174], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:17:52)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes. So that means the ICE coverage area in millions of square kilometers is like [dropping](`laser_indexes=[175], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:18:01)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. What appears to be there's a [rather constant trend](`laser_indexes=[176], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:18:11)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah it's pretty much like lower.

[(00:18:15)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah sure.

[(00:18:21)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Not really sure about. I'm just like confused about something. So they all kind of start from [the same point](`laser_indexes=[178], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). Right. In terms of wide scale if you think about it this goes [lower](`laser_indexes=[179], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). Definitely. Is this like a dropage. What does this actually mean? Like ICE coverage area in millions of square kilometers.

[(00:18:51)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  So I think it's saying in [April](`laser_indexes=[180], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) there are roughly [15 million](`laser_indexes=[181,182], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) IFFCs in [the architecture](`laser_indexes=[183,184], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:19:03)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Got you.

[(00:19:04)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  And then that overtime has [decreased](`laser_indexes=[186], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) every year there's like this [flux](`laser_indexes=[187], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) of like you gain [ICE](`laser_indexes=[188], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) from [January](`laser_indexes=[189], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) to [February](`laser_indexes=[190], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`). [January](`laser_indexes=[191], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) to [April](`laser_indexes=[192], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) starts to [drop off](`laser_indexes=[193], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:19:22)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  The summer and then it starts pulling back up again.

[(00:19:27)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  September.

[(00:19:28)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  That makes sense. So I guess overall it is kind of like showing that seasonal nature right. It does have this pattern. So to make a continuous thing it's just going to be like periodic.

[(00:19:40)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  That is such a [massive change](`laser_indexes=[198], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`).

[(00:19:45)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah same. And I feel like if you think about the [overall drop](`laser_indexes=[199], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) there's still going to be like a sine wave but every year it's like going down like this I guess right? Yeah but it does show like pattern for sure.

[(00:20:07)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Which will also be interesting though because I think [the trend line](`laser_indexes=[200], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) is that sign.

[(00:20:12)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. If you think about [the trend line](`laser_indexes=[202], current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) I definitely think it's just going to be like a downward trend. But it also shows the seasonality because you do gain something. Right like every year and then you lose some during summer then you gain again. So yeah in terms of climate change you can say definitely the ICE coverage is going down. That means the global temperature increasing. Probably. That's most of the reason. So that's pretty much what I understand from this chart.

[(00:20:48)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Same interpretation.

[(00:20:52)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah. Should we move to like another chart? Yeah I think so. Do you want me to pick?

[(00:21:03)](`current_vis="ArcticSeaIce.jpg"`) Bob:  Sure yeah.

[(00:21:04)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay cool. So yes we can take a look at the bar chart. Hurricanes and cyclones with maximum sustained wind over 110 mph from 1950 to 2020. And I guess this is also climate change data. Okay [this is the average line](`laser_indexes=[204], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:21:32)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I swing the cut [five](`laser_indexes=[205], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) cut [three](`laser_indexes=[206,207], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) overlay to color the light [purple](`laser_indexes=[208,209], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:21:41)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:21:42)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  [Category three](`laser_indexes=[211], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:21:48)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay so the darker the color is the scarier. Yes. Yeah. In terms of trends I would say like most of the data if you take a look at it I'm not sure how to relate [this trend line here](`laser_indexes=[215], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) with this data. Let me take a look at it.

[(00:22:14)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah so it's the average over ten years since roughly [this](`laser_indexes=[217], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). So [rolling averages](`laser_indexes=[218], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) are always right or [ten years](`laser_indexes=[219], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) correct.

[(00:22:29)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  No what I think is what I've seen at least like from COVID data rolling average is like on [these years](`laser_indexes=[220], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) basically. So from [1960s to 1970 whatever you have you average it and then you kind of interpolate it to present it with different lines](`laser_indexes=[221], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) I guess.

[(00:22:49)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah. I guess my question is [say that 1970](`laser_indexes=[222], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) was [this](`laser_indexes=[223], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) correlate to [the previous](`laser_indexes=[224], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`)? This is [the average of the previous ten years](`laser_indexes=[225], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) or is it [five plus the previous five](`laser_indexes=[226], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`)?

[(00:23:03)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  That is a good question.

[(00:23:07)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I'm trying to remember that.

[(00:23:11)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  What I remember from a thing like seeing [the middle](`laser_indexes=[227], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and [average COVID data](`laser_indexes=[228], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) it's like let's say on Sunday you're canceling also previous data that you have up until that Sunday and then you canceling [the average](`laser_indexes=[229], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) and you have that data. Whatever we have that represents like previous ten years data and you average.

[(00:23:43)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I don't know how you would do an average [future data](`laser_indexes=[231], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) that you don't have on.

[(00:23:47)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Exactly. So I guess this is probably like [previous data](`laser_indexes=[232], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) [rolling average](`laser_indexes=[233], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:23:58)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  It's interesting that they have [that](`laser_indexes=[236], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). So [high](`laser_indexes=[237], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) means I guess they have [previous data show](`laser_indexes=[238], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:24:04)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes but [this](`laser_indexes=[240], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) is the. I'm just like thinking that [these colors](`laser_indexes=[241], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) they basically just represent [different categories](`laser_indexes=[242], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Right? Yeah but what's the granularity of it? I'm not sure. For example like [this box](`laser_indexes=[243], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) what does the daily data [storms](`laser_indexes=[244], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`)?

[(00:24:39)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I think it's [per year](`laser_indexes=[248], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). [Per year](`laser_indexes=[249], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). So this is like two or three category three storms. And then [the rest](`laser_indexes=[251], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) up to. I guess that's probably [eleven storms total](`laser_indexes=[252], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). [The remaining](`laser_indexes=[253,254], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:24:57)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay cool. That makes sense. Kind of like a stack bar chart.

[(00:25:02)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Yes.

[(00:25:03)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay.

[(00:25:04)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  That's exactly the interpretation.

[(00:25:07)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  I guess it can be like monthly. Do you think it's monthly because it's yearly? There's like a [huge gap](`laser_indexes=[255], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:25:14)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I think it's purely yearly otherwise because [this](`laser_indexes=[257], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) seems to be all 1960s and [that](`laser_indexes=[258], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) first jumps up to [1980](`laser_indexes=[259], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). So there's [months](`laser_indexes=[260], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`).

[(00:25:26)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Okay. Right in my head I was just thinking like from [1960](`laser_indexes=[261], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) we jumped straight to [1970](`laser_indexes=[262], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). But there are like ten years between the diamonds. But yeah overall it just seems like this category [glor storm](`laser_indexes=[263], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) kind of increases.

[(00:25:50)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  That's something I'm actually sort of saying [there are more storms over the wall](`laser_indexes=[264], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). But it's hard for me to distinguish whether there is a proportional increase in say category five.

[(00:26:06)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Especially for [category five](`laser_indexes=[266], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). It just seems like there's no definite global pattern that it goes up like [this purple line](`laser_indexes=[267], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) loses a lot but in [this area](`laser_indexes=[268,269], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) at least I see a little bit more of the immediate purple color compared to.

[(00:26:26)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  What I was just thinking is I focus purely on [the category three](`laser_indexes=[270,271,272,273,274], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). It looks like it was previously kind of maybe a little bit higher than it is later on or [the same](`laser_indexes=[275,276,277,278,279], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) or slightly lower which would apply that there's more severe slims.

[(00:26:50)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Overall for [category three](`laser_indexes=[281], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). I kind of see very [distant numbers](`laser_indexes=[282], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) overall. It does [increase](`laser_indexes=[283], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) a lot since we have [values like this](`laser_indexes=[284], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) but it's not like a lot.

[(00:27:03)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  Yeah this is also interesting to me.

[(00:27:05)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Like [these two years](`laser_indexes=[286], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) they were significantly or like in significantly lower than [the strength](`laser_indexes=[287], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) but they kind of had like equal amount of [the category](`laser_indexes=[288], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). [Five to category](`laser_indexes=[289], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) there are fewer strong.

[(00:27:21)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I don't know. I only just started relating all the data to [the title](`laser_indexes=[291], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). I just reread the title and it says once you're going from celestial right?

[(00:27:34)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Yes.

[(00:27:36)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  The only thing I see definitively [here](`laser_indexes=[292], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) I think there is evidence if you [look really closely](`laser_indexes=[293], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) but it takes a second to see as we were discussing that there are strong storms but I think mostly just immediately it says that there are more swarms than a larger.

[(00:27:55)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  [Exactly](`laser_indexes=[294], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). Yeah that's true. So I guess we can say go ahead.

[(00:28:02)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Bob:  I don't know how many storms there are in general though because [these](`laser_indexes=[295], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) are only the swarms that are over 100 probably. Maybe there are just also more [storms](`laser_indexes=[295], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`). And so it's like maybe. I don't know if that means storms are going stronger or if it says storms are being more frequent.

[(00:28:18)](`current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) Alice:  Yeah I guess for the [frequency matter](`laser_indexes=[296], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) we can't really derive and put [this chart](`laser_indexes=[297], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) right because we just have [numbers](`laser_indexes=[298], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) in the category of [those storms](`laser_indexes=[299], current_vis="Storms.jpg"`) for each year. But yeah I guess.
